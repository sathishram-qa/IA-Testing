Purpose: Demonstrate how Watir-Webdriver, Cucumber and Sikuli *might* work together

What this does, is use watir-webdriver goodness to do all the web work and then delegates horrid UI to be verified by Sikuli instead.
I few key warnings- 
1) Its modal. If you have a window eg. command prompt, open in front of the browser, sikuli wont find the image.
2) The opencv libraries are a nasty, nasty dependency. I've compiled them for you for Mac OS X, but all bets are off elsewhere for this demo.
3) Due to .jar's for sikuli- this is Jruby land.
4) I havent tested this on a clean workstation, will try it tonight and make whatever changes I can to make this machine independant.

Setup:

./setup
./go

Should result in this:
/Projects/watir-webdriver_and_sikuli_example 58 $ bundle exec rake
/Users/yomomma/.rvm/rubies/jruby-1.6.5/bin/jruby -S bundle exec cucumber  --profile everything
Using the everything profile...
